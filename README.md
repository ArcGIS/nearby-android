This repo provides an example app called Nearby Places for Android devices built with the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/).  With some minor customization, you can change the types of places displayed or simply use the app as is.

Visit Esri's [**open source app site**](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/nearby-android/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=example_apps_nearby_android) to read more about this app and how the Runtime features are implemented.
Join our [**GeoNet community**](https://community.esri.com/community/developers/native-app-developers/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-android) and keep up to date on the latest discussions about open source apps!

## Features

 * Geocoding with categories
 * Displaying device location
 * Calculating bearing and distance

## Detailed Documentation

Read the [docs](./docs/README.md) for a detailed explanation of the application, including its architecture and how it leverages the ArcGIS platform, as well as how you can begin using the app right away.

## Development Instructions

This Nearby Places repo is an Android Studio Project and App Module that can be directly cloned and imported into Android Studio.

### Fork the Repo

**Fork** the [Nearby Places Android](https://github.com/Esri/nearby-android/fork) repo.

### Clone the Repo

Once you have forked the repo, you can make a clone.

#### Command Line Git

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork) the Nearby Places repo.
2. `cd` into the `nearby-android` folder.
3. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

### Configuring a Remote for a Fork

If you make changes in the fork and would like to [sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) those changes with the upstream repository, you must first [configure the remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/). This will be required when you have created local branches and would like to make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to your upstream branch.

1. In the Terminal (for Mac users) or command prompt (for Windows and Linux users) type `git remote -v` to list the current configured remote repo for your fork.
2. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/nearby-android.git` to specify new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork. You can type `git remote -v` to verify the new upstream.

If there are changes made in the Original repository, you can sync the fork to keep it updated with upstream repository.

1. In the terminal, change the current working directory to your local project.
2. Type `git fetch upstream` to fetch the commits from the upstream repository.
3. `git checkout master` to checkout your fork's local master branch.
4. `git merge upstream/master` to sync your local `master` branch with `upstream/master`. **Note**: Your local changes will be retained and your fork's master branch will be in sync with the upstream repository.
